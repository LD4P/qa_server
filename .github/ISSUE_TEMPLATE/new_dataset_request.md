about: This issue template is for LD4P2 requests for a new data source to be added to QA.

_Please only use this issue template for LD4P2 partner and cohort requests for a new data source to be added to QA. If your requesting changes to how a dataset currently available in QA is treated, please use the indexing bug issue template._

__For each request provide the following:__


Data source name and URL:

Link to download of all data:

Link to Documentation on APIs providing linked data: (N.B. only necessary if a download of all the data is not available)

Link to spreadsheet tab in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rPvEoP9iYNkxJ0eWC8gXe3ci7e6mhW0da59xkGhadi0/edit?usp=sharing, with indexing information for the data source:


__Next steps:__

After the initial set up of the dataset in QA based on the information provided above, the requester will be contacted and asked to create accuracy tests. 

__Further Guidance:__

More direction on the steps in requesting a dataset in QA (including writing accuracy tests) can be found at: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/LD4P2/Request+a+New+Dataset+For+QA

Email sf433 @ cornell dot edu with questions.


_Please note, all requests for new data sources in QA will be prioritized by the LD4P2 project. Due to time restrictions there is no guarantee that all requests will be added to QA during the lifetime of the LD4P2 grant; regardless of resources it is still useful to know which datasets the community would find useful in such a lookup service._

name: 'Request a New Dataset for QA:'
about: This issue template is for LD4P2 requests for a new data source to be added to QA.

---

_Please only use this issue template for LD4P2 requests for a new data source to be added to QA. If your requesting changes to how a dataset currently available in QA is treated, please use the indexing bug issue template._

__For LD4P2 partners and cohorts:__

Please perform each task listed below. (Email sf433 @ cornell dot edu with questions):

- [ ] Identify the data source: (Include the Data Source Name and its homepage URL)
- [ ] Add a new tab and indexing information for the data source to the following spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rPvEoP9iYNkxJ0eWC8gXe3ci7e6mhW0da59xkGhadi0/edit?usp=sharing.
- [ ] Add a YAML test file to https://github.com/cul-it/qa_server/tree/master/config/authorities/linked_data/scenarios. Follow https://github.com/cul-it/qa_server/blob/master/config/authorities/linked_data/scenarios/locgenres_ld4l_cache_validation.yml as an example of an accuracy test.


_Please note, all requests for new data sources in QA will be prioritized by the LD4P2 project. Due to time restrictions there is no guarantee that all requests will be added to QA during the lifetime of the LD4P2 grant; regardless of resources it is still useful to know which datasets the community would find useful in such a lookup service._
